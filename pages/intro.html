      <h2>Purpose and Importance of Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of our project is to view the extent of treatment coverage
        for HIV/AIDS in countries globally and ART treatment's impact on the
        number of people living with HIV and compare the amount of people
        living with HIV by region.
      </p>
      <h2>Leading Questions of Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        We have included several graphics of the data,
        which aims to answer a few questions about global HIV rates and
        ART treatment:
        <ol>
          <li>How do ART coverage rates for those living with HIV differ between
            countries within certain regions?</li>
          <li>What are the incidence rates and amount of deaths caused by HIV in
            countries during selected time periods?</li>
          <li>What are the estimated total number of cases of HIV, the total
            coverage, and proportion of coverage to cases in countries globally?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

        <h2>Sources of Dataset</h2>
        <p>
          The data was collected and generated by WHO and UNESCO from their public records
          on the number of people living with HIV/AIDS around the world. Devakumar cleaned
          that data from WHO and UNESCO and put the data into a CSV file that draws a focus
          on treatment statistics for those living with HIV/AIDS by country.

        </p>
        <p>
          We added another dataset to to add latitude and longitude for all the countries:
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/latitude-and-longitude-for-every-country-and-state">
            Latitude and longitude</a>
          This dataset was created by Paul Mooney and updated one year ago,
          ensuring that the data we present is still prevelant and recent. Paul
          Mooney utlized a countries csv that was published to the Google
          Public Data Explorer in the Dataset Publishing Language format.
        </p>
        <p>
          We added another dataset that tracks the amount of deathes from HIV from
          1990 to 2017 to see how the availability of ART (antiretroviral therapy)
          has impacted death rates over time:

          This dataset, published by Our World in Data, includes numbers that
          were sourced from studies done by the Global Burden of Disease
          Collaborative Network.
