      <section id="conclusion">
        <p>
          Through organizing, wrangling and visualizing our datasets regarding
          global HIV and ART coverage rates We have been able to make several
          major conlcusions.
          <br>
          <br>
          Based of the first bar chart on page one, we have
          found that in the Eastern Mediterranean, the country with the highest
          ART coverage among people with HIV is Jordan. In Africa, the country
          with the highest coverage is Namibia, in the Americas it is Peru, in
          Europe it is Italy, in the Western Pacific it is Australia, and lastly,
          in South-East Asia it is Thailand. Overall, the Americas has the lowest
          ART coverage for those with HIV and Africa and Europe have the highest.
          <br>
          <br>
          The map visual on the second page, gave us insight on the proportion of
          ART coverage to cases of HIV within regions globally. Through this map
          we were able to reognize that many of the regions, Africa, the Americas,
          and Western Pacific all have very similar proprotions , around 0.62-0.63.
          We also saw the the Eastern Mediterranean has the lowest proprotion of
          0.21, and Southeast Asia has the second lowest at 0.47. Europe has the
          highest proprotion at 0.71. We see that since the Eastern Mediterranean
          has the lowest proprotion of art coverage to HIV cases that countries
          within this region need to prioritize getting ART and making it more
          accessible to those suffering from HIV. From this map we also can see
          that the Eastern Mediterranean also has the lowest total cases of HIV
          out of all the regions, therefore this may be why they do not prioritize
          ART coverage as much as regions such as Africa that have incredibly high
          number of cases of HIV.
          <br>
          <br>
          Lastly, the line chart on page three shows the trends of incidences of HIV,
          death rates of HIV, and prevelance of HIV in countries globally between
          1990-2017. We are able to infer from these charts for each country that
          while there have not been decreases in incidences or prevleance of HIV
          across time, there has been a stabilization and even decrease in deaths
          for most countries across the globe. This trend is most likely due
          to ART, which is able to help people with HIV maintain longer and healthier
          lives, despite HIV still not being able to be cured fully.
